This folder holds an example set demonstrating how the twinBASIC DLL can be used without registration. You can find the 32- and 64-bit versions of the DLL's in the https://github.com/GCuser99/SolverWrapper/tree/main/src/twinBASIC/Build folder of this repository.

THIS IS NOT THE RECOMMENDED SETUP, but just to show the possibilities....
